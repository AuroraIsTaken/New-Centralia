            <h2>History of Centralia</h2>
            <p>Centralia, Pennsylvania, was once a bustling mining town founded in the mid-19th century, thriving on the anthracite coal industry. In May 1962, a landfill fire ignited an exposed coal mine, causing an underground mine fire that has burned ever since. The fire spread through a maze of abandoned coal mines beneath the town, releasing dangerous levels of toxic gases and creating hazardous sinkholes. Despite numerous attempts to extinguish it, the fire was uncontrollable. As the situation worsened, the government ordered the town's evacuation in the 1980s. Today, Centralia is nearly abandoned, with only a few residents remaining, and much of its infrastructure destroyed.</p>

            <h2>Our Goal</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to revitalize Centralia, transforming it into New Centraliaâ€”a safe, sustainable, and state-of-the-art smart city. The first priority is to address the underground mine fire by controlling it, ensuring the ground and air quality are safe for residents. Our infrastructure will include high-speed internet, IoT devices for efficient city management, smart grids for optimal energy distribution, and cutting-edge public transportation systems. New Centralia will also feature modern residential and commercial buildings with energy-efficient designs, and amenities that support a high quality of life.</p>

            <h2>Harnessing The Fire</h2>
            <p>The underground mine fire will be harnessed to create a "geothermal" power plant, generating cheap and relatively clean electricity. By tapping into the consistent heat produced by the fire, this geothermal plant will convert thermal energy into electricity. This energy provides a cheap power source for the new city's infrastructure. From this ouir residents will have the cheapest electricity in the nation/</p>
